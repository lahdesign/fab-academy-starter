	<h1>Final Project, Concept</h1>
	<h2>Week One</h2>
</header>
	<p> 
   Late in 2013, I was diagnosed with an auto-immune disorder and was told by my doctor to change almost every aspect of my life. Overwhelmed by my diagnosis, I began reading about the topic of change and learned that exacting real change is a slow, contemplative practice. It takes between 21-30 days to form a new habit and you can only successfully change one habit at a time. I had arrived at a solution that felt realistic and began to change one thing about myself every month and it worked. 
   </p>
<p>
Other people struggling with health challenges began to ask me if I had any suggestions on how to track this change and see their progress over time. While there are apps that will help you to track lifestyle changes, I found that the intimacy of tracking this change was lost when handling with a glowing screen or sharing with your social network. 
</p>
<p>
Being a book designer, I started to think of a solution using folded paper. The resulting item was a book that had tear off tabs on the fore-edge. Each page represented a day and and each day there would be new items to tear off. While I liked this as an object, I wished for there to be a way that the data was being collected
</p>

<p>
What if there was something between and app and a book, a physical object that you could spend time with, mediate or reflect with, but that it was also collecting the data that you input every day? For my final project, I would like to make this object.
